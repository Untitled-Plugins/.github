## 🐝 The Bee Suite

Welcome to the Bee Suite, a swarm of plugins for Paper 1.19–1.22 designed to make playing and running your 
server as smooth as honey flowing from the hive! Each plugin has a purpose, but together they form a buzzing
ecosystem that keeps your server- er hive, alive, safe, and fun.

### Our Swarm of Plugins:

Honeycomb – The foundation of the hive. Without it, the Bee Suite has no structure. Think of it as the wax that keeps everything together!

HoneyGuard – Guards your honey with the efficiency of a hexagon! Protects blocks, ores, and regions from griefers or sneaky bees (players) trying to steal what’s yours.

PollenEnforcer – The hive’s disciplinary swarm. Tempbans, jails, and IP bans—punishment delivered with sting precision.

BuzzClaims – Claim land like a true bee defending their territory. FLAN-style region claiming… now with a honey twist!

StingFun – When the hive needs a break, this module brings the fun. Chess, Soccer, UNO, Blackjack, Poker, Play Gun—mini-games for the whole swarm.

QueenQOL – Smooths out the hive’s daily life. Quality-of-life tweaks for players and admins alike; keeps your server buzzing efficiently.

### Why The Bee Suite?

Running a server shouldn’t feel like being chased by hornets. The Bee Suite combines protection, moderation,
claiming, fun, and quality-of-life improvements—all in a single cohesive hive. Let your players enjoy the 
honey of the game without worrying about the sting of griefers, trollers, cheaters, or chaos.
